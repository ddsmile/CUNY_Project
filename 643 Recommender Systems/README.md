(Prashanth Padebettu, Parshu Rath, Adejare Windokun, Xingjia Wu)

The main objective of this project is to build a context-aware recommender system using the Movielens dataset on Apache Spark cluster system. The goal is to incorporate contextual information (such as Time) in order to deliver not just movie recommendations but also unique user experiences shaped by user context, and take advantage of the distributed computing power to handle processing of large scale data and thus increasing relevance of the recommendation models to the users by reducing latency.
